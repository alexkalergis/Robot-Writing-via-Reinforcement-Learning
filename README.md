# Robot-Writing-via-Reinforcement-Learning
This project is about creating a virtual environment of a 2-DOF robot that tries to learn how to write characters and shapes via reinforcement learning. Specifically we create 2 agents that uses two different Q-learning methods. Firstly, we use the simple Q-Learning algorithm and second the Deep Q-Learning. Finally, we compare the desired results and the algorithm performances.
