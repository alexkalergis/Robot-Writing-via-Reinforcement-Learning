# Robot-Writing-via-Reinforcement-Learning
This project creates a virtual environment of a 2DOF robot that tires to learn how to write characters and shapes via reinforcement learning. Specifically we create 2 agents that uses two different Q-learning methods. First, the simple Q-Learning and second the Deep Q-Learning. Finally, we compare the desired results and the algorithm performances.
